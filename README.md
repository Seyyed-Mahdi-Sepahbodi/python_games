# Python Games
>In this repository I develop some mini video games with python.
Since I don't know about GUI libraries of python I use youtube videos for designing the appearance of the games **BUT** I try to write their logic by myself.<br>

Here is the list of games:
--
* 1_[Pong](https://github.com/Seyyed-Mahdi-Sepahbodi/python_games/tree/main/Pong)
* 2_[Snake](https://github.com/Seyyed-Mahdi-Sepahbodi/python_games/tree/main/Snake)
